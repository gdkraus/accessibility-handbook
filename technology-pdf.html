        <p>PDF files are popular because they give the author exact control over the look and feel of a document, regardless of the platform on which the end user is viewing the content. Also there are numerous PDF creation tools that integrate with almost any application.</p>
        <p>However, PDF documents are very difficult to make accessible. Only a few applications will make a PDF accessible with no additional work. Making a PDF file accessible usually involves using tools in Adobe Acrobat Professional to add accessibility information. The tools are cumbersome and clunky and usually require a significant amount of effort to use. Additionally, if you invest all of the work in making a PDF file accessible, if you later need to go back to your original source document to make changes and create a new PDF file, all of your previous accessibility retrofitting will be lost.</p>
        <p class="tip">Making your first PDF document accessible is kind of fun because you learn all kinds of new skills and tools. The second PDF you have to make accessible is a real pain.</p>
        <p>Some applications that do offer some native accessibility support for creating PDFs without additional work in Adobe Acrobat are</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, but only under limited circumstances. The document needs to be text-only, you need to use Word's headings, and it has to be authored from a Windows computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Adobe InDesign</strong>, but careful planning from the very beginning must be made in order to ensure the PDF is accessible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While PDF files are viewable on a large range of products, they also bring up the issue of is it better to provide a file the user has to download or should it all be available online. If the page can be rendered as HTML, it doesn't require a download and it viewable on an even wider range of products.</p>
        <p>When possible, PDF files should be avoided because of the lack of support in easily creating and maintaining accessible documents. If you need to use a PDF, be sure to plan thoroughly to ensure that your document can be made as accessible as possible.</p>
        <p>Here is a demonstration of how a screen reader experiences an untagged PDF.</p>
