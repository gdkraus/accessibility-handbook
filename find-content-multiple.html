        <h1>Multiple Ways to Find Content</h1>
        <p>It is important to provide users multiple ways of discovering content on your site. Some users may start at your home page and see where the links take them, while others may use your menu structure, while still others will use a search feature.</p>
        <p>You need to provide at least two ways to navigate your site. The possibilities include the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a menu system to allow users to navigate to major sections of your site.</li>
            <li>Providing links on each page that explicitly take you to the next and previous page within your site.</li>
            <li>Providing a set of links at the bottom of each page that will take you to pages within your site that are related to it, like a collection of &quot;Related Resources&quot;.</li>
            <li>Providing a site map.</li>
            <li>Providing a search function.</li>
            <li>Providing a table of contents for each page that links to the major sections of the page. This is different than a site-wide table of contents.</li>
            <li>Providing links to all of the other pages of your site from each page. This is only suitable for small sites.</li>
            <li>Linking to all of the pages on the site from the home page.</li>
        </ul>
