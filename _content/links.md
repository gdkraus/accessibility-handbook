Overview
--------

Links must meet several criteria in order to be accessible.

-   All links must contain either text or an image with alt text.
-   Link text needs to be uniquely identifiable within the page.
-   The link text should be descriptive of its target location.
-   The link text should not be too long.
-   When possible and appropriate, donâ€™t make the target URL the actual
    hyperlink text.
-   Do not remove the underline from links except in cases like menus.
-   Links should notify the user if they are going to open in a new
    window.
