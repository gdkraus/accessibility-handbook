PDF files are popular because they give the author exact control over
the look and feel of a document, regardless of the platform on which the
end user is viewing the content. Also there are numerous PDF creation
tools that integrate with almost any application.

However, PDF documents are very difficult to make accessible. Only a few
applications will make a PDF accessible with no additional work. Making
a PDF file accessible usually involves using tools in Adobe Acrobat
Professional to add accessibility information. The tools are cumbersome
and clunky and usually require a significant amount of effort to use.
Additionally, if you invest all of the work in making a PDF file
accessible, if you later need to go back to your original source
document to make changes and create a new PDF file, all of your previous
accessibility retrofitting will be lost.

Making your first PDF document accessible is kind of fun because you
learn all kinds of new skills and tools. The second PDF you have to make
accessible is a real pain.

Some applications that do offer some native accessibility support for
creating PDFs without additional work in Adobe Acrobat are

-   **Microsoft Word**, but only under limited circumstances. The
    document needs to be text-only, you need to use Word's headings, and
    it has to be authored from a Windows computer.
-   **Adobe InDesign**, but careful planning from the very beginning
    must be made in order to ensure the PDF is accessible.

While PDF files are viewable on a large range of products, they also
bring up the issue of is it better to provide a file the user has to
download or should it all be available online. If the page can be
rendered as HTML, it doesn't require a download and it viewable on an
even wider range of products.

When possible, PDF files should be avoided because of the lack of
support in easily creating and maintaining accessible documents. If you
need to use a PDF, be sure to plan thoroughly to ensure that your
document can be made as accessible as possible.

Here is a demonstration of how a screen reader experiences an untagged
PDF.
