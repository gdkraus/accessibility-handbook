The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) (WCAG 2.0) are a set of standards
defines by the W3C that define how to make Web content more accessible
to people with disabilities. All of the accessibility work of the
[W3C](http://www.w3.org/) is housed under the [Web Accessibility
Initiative](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) (WAI). WCAG 2.0 defines four
principles which provide the foundation for Web accessibility.

-   **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be
    presented to users in ways that they can perceive, regardless of the
    user’s functional impairment
-   **Operable** - user interface components and navigation must be
    operable, regardless of the assistive technology used to interact
    with the interface
-   **Understandable** - information and the operation of the user
    interface must be predictable and understandable to the user
-   **Robust** - content must be robust enough to be able to be
    transformed and interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, like
    assistive technologies

In addition to the principles there are a set of guidelines which expand
the principles by delineating a set of goals content creators should
have in making their content accessible. The guidelines are not
themselves testable, but rather a set of “Success Criteria” are given
that are testable. The Success Criteria have three different conformance
levels - A, AA, and AAA, with AAA being the most accessible.
Additionally there are “Sufficient and Advisory Techniques” that
demonstrate coding techniques.

Further, there are a number of techniques and guidelines in addition to
WCAG 2.0, such as how to make rich internet applications accessible
(ARIA), how user agents like browsers should be made accessible, and
more. All of this information is available from the [Web Accessibility
Initiative](http://www.w3.org/WAI/).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) is a rich and
complex standard. Sometimes it can be difficult to understand all
aspects of WCAG 2.0. This guide is largely based on the work surrounding
WCAG 2.0, however, it presents it in a more approachable manner for
those newer to Web accessibility. Additionally, some of the additional
techniques in the ARIA suite are presented here too.
