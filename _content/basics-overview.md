There are a lot of things we take for granted when designing and viewing
Web pages. For instance, browsers are very forgiving of bad code, and
they can make a page with bad code look better than it should based
solely on the code. Can all browsers and all assistive technologies
handle bad code as gracefully? We usually assume that the viewers to our
Web site will understand the language it's in, and we assume that if
they use an assistive technology that it will be able to easily
understand the language too. What if a user whose screen reader is set
to read Spanish comes to an English Web page? How will the screen reader
know how to speak the words?

The point is there are some assumptions we often make that we probably
should not make because we don't know who will be accessing our site or
how they will be accessing it.
