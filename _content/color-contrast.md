Overview
--------

You need to ensure that your foreground and background colors have
enough contrast so that users with visual disabilities can read your
content. This is true for the main text of your document, menus and
navigation, and any hover/focus effects you apply to elements.

Ensuring you have enough color contrast for all users is a complex
subject when you try to consider all of the different types of visual
disabilities. The W3C has defined a formula to determine if two colors
have enough contrast to ensure that **most** people with visual
disabilities will be able to access the content.

You will want to achieve at least AA conformance on your pages. AAA
performance is ideal, but it can be difficult to use a robust color
palette and achieve AAA conformance.

There are several tools available to help you determine the color
contrast.

-   [Accessible Color Palette
    Evaluator](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/index.php),
    useful for examining the accessibility of lots of color
    combinations.
-   [Contrast Analyser for Windows and
    Mac](http://paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastAnalyser), useful
    for selecting colors with an eyedropper for analysis.
-   [Juicy Studio Accessibility
    Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/juicy-studio-accessibility-too/),
    useful for generating a report of all possible color combinations
    for a Web page based on the CSS.
