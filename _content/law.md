First, this guide primarily cover accessibility regulations and United
States Federal Law. Other countries have different laws, and individual
states might have additional requirements beyond Federal law. Also, this
document covers these laws at a very high level and only highlights
portions of each law.

The applicable laws regarding Web accessibility are as follows.

-   Americans with Disabilities Act
-   Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
-   UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (This is
    not covered in this document and does not impact the U.S because the
    U.S. has not ratified it, but it has been ratified by 129 other
    countries.)

What laws apply to me
---------------------

Each of the subsequent pages in this section gives more specifics on the
applicability of these laws, but in short, in light of actions from the
Access Board and the Department of Justice, **all institutions, both
public and private, should plan on providing equitable access to their
services and conform to WCAG 2 Level AA conformance.** The two recent
actions are as follows.

-   The Access Board is currently updating Section 508 to be more in
    line with the requirements of WCAG 2, Level AA Conformance.
-   The Department of Justice is currently updating the Americans with
    Disabilities Act to explicitly require all Title II and Title III
    entities to provide accessible Web presences and conform to
    standards equivalent to WCAG 2 Level AA conformance.

Currently there are different interpretations of what laws apply to who,
and there are not clear standards defined for how each law defines what
is technically accessible. However, as just stated both laws are
converging on the WCAG 2 Level AA conformance, and the way the laws are
being written they will apply to virtually every institution.
