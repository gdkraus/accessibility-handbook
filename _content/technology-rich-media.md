Within HTML documents there are additional third-party applications or
formats that can provide rich content. The three most popular are

-   Video and Audio
-   Flash
-   Sliverlight
-   Java

Video and audio can be made quite accessible. Usually what is required
is you need to provide

-   A synchronized transcript (captions) for video
-   A transcript for audio
-   A media player that people with disabilities can interact with

Flash, Silverlight, and Java can be made accessible, however, it
involves a set of techniques that most developers of these technologies
don't know or don't follow. It will take extra work to make the content
accessible. Additionally, Flash and Silverlight will only be accessible
to several user groups when they use Internet Explorer. Often these
technologies are used to provide cross-platform compatibility. There are
several newer techniques with HTML and ARIA that might be able to
accomplish the same goal as Flash, Silverlight, and Java.
