Office documents vary in terms of how much accessibility support they
provide. Documents such as Microsoft Office documents can be made quite
accessible. There are techniques to provide semantic structure to the
pages, like headings, and to also add in extra accessibility
information, like alternative textual descriptions, when needed. Office
documents have the disadvantage in that they frequently require a
third-party application to view.

Since many PDF documents start as office documents, sometimes it is
easier and more accessible to simply provide users the original office
document instead of the PDF document.

Some office documents, such as Google Docs, still provide significant
accessibility problems, so in terms of accessibility, these products
should be avoided as the sole means of conveying information.
