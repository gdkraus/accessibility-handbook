        <h3>Keyboard-only Test</h3>
        <p>One of the most effective and easiest tests for accessibility is to see if you can completely interact with your site using only your keyboard.</p>
        <h3>Screen readers</h3>
        <p>Screen readers should not be your first tool for testing for accessibility. Screen readers are specialized pieces of software that have a steep learning curve to use effectively. Designing to standards and using other tools to confirm that the UI has been implemented accessibly should be used instead.</p>
        <p>Additionally, just because something works with a screen reader does not mean it is accessible with all types of assistive technology and for people with other types of disabilities.</p>
        <p>However, there are times when a screen reader is necessary for testing. This is usually when you are implementing non-standard controls and using ARIA. If you do need to use a screen reader, these are your main options.</p>
